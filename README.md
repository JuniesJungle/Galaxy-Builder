# Solar-Systems

Comming soon 
I'm still in the brainstorming process for what I'd like to accomplish with this. 

The basic idea is meant for world building for people who want to try and have their world be a plausible/functioning solar system so I want something that follows a lot of Astrophysics Theories on planetary systems. 
Some things I want to include are:
~the ability to choose a sun type and have a slider for the size of said sun based on the type of sun they chose
  (that is to say that certain sun types have a rang of size/mass/densities that are realistically possible so the user should be limited to those constraints)
~guides based on the chosen sun to show where the habitable zone is for a planet that could theoretically sustain life
~the ability to choose types of planets and have a slider for the size based on the planet type they chose 
~the ability to add moons to the plannets

I'm still in the research phase using my Aerospace Engineering degree to plan out theoretical formulas and information to best represent what theoretically would happen in certain events to give a most basic theoretical understanding of Solar Systems.

I'm also trying to get a blog going on my web portfolio so I can make regular updates for this project there to show others how my work progresses.

I'm really looking forward to this project and can't wait to get started soon.
